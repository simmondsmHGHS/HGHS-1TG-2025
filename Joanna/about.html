            <h2>How this club runs:</h2>
            <p>Students are given a camera to take photos with for two weeks.</p>
            <p>Once the two weeks are up, all members of the club meet in D5 at lunchtime to look over all of the photos accumulated over the two week timeframe.</p>
            <p>All members decide on the best photos taken which will then be posted to the schoolâ€™s social media (HGHS Facebook and Instagram).</p>
