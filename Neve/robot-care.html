        <h1>ROBOT CARE</h1>
        <p>Itâ€™s important to know <span>how</span> to take care of the robots in this club and how to properly use them.</p>
        <p>Here's how you can ensure you take good care of the robots:</p>

        <div class="robot-buttons">
            <div class="p-container">
                <p>When using the robot, you will find a screen that has six buttons.</p>
                <p>The most important buttons are the <span>cancel</span> and <span>enter</span> buttons. The other four are used for <span>moving around</span> (up, down, left, and right).</p>
                <p>The <span>cancel</span> button is used to cancel any program currently running and to turn off the robot. If a program is running and you want it to stop, press the cancel button and it should stop.</p>
                <p>The <span>enter</span> button is used to choose a program or setting. Pressing it will choose and start the program.</p>

        <div class="robot-buttons robot-screens">
            <div class="p-container">
                <p>The screen is used to <span>change settings or select a program</span>. When using a robot, you only need to use the first two screens.</p>
                <p>The first screen has all of the recent programs in it. Select the program that you want to run by using the up and down buttons, then press the enter key to select it.</p>
                <p>You can get to the second screen by using the right arrow. This is where all of the programs are kept in folders. When you select a program there, you need to press the down button and select the program with the play button on the left of the name. This will play the program.</p>

        <div class="robot-buttons robot-sensors">
            <div class="p-container">
                <p>The robot has been set up in a cuboid base with all of the sensors that you will need attached to it already. Each sensor and motor is connected to the robot in specific spots.</p>
                <p>These sensors and motors are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Ultrasonic sensor</p></li>
                    <li><p>Colour sensor</p></li>
                    <li><p>Large motor</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>Do not change or move any of these sensors and motors</span>. They are set up in specific locations to work properly on robots, and moving them will affect you and the people who use the robot after you.</p>
