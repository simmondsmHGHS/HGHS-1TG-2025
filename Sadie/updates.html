                <p>This week we are thrilled and honoured to celebrate one of our truly valued and honorable members, Hargun Kaur.<br>
                    She has a brilliant and spectacular attitude towards her peers, demonstrating acts of kinship and connection without any effort.<br>
                    She is a wonderful and perfect example of a positive, strong-minded individual, we feel incredibly fortunate to have her as apart of our team.<br>
                    Every week this refreshes and we acknowledge the actions of a specific member. If you wish to be shown upon our website, showcase an upmost respectful attitude and attend every compulsory event within the club.
