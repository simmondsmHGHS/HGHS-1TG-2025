            <h2>Breeders</h2>
            <p>Breeders are an option many people go with for adopting their pets. The cats produced by breeders are typically bred to have more desirable traits, which makes them 
                a more expensive option. It may also take you a while to find a breeder with the type of cat you want, making it time consuming as well. Cats sold by breeders are 
                commonly at least 8-10 weeks old, meaning they are still kittens when you adopt them. Taking care of kittens can be demanding, so looking for older cats might be 
                better for those who work for most of the day. However, this means that you can personally train how they behave, making preventing bad behaviour much easier.</p>

        <div class="shelters">
            <h2>Rescue Shelters</h2>
            <p>Rescue shelters are also a good option. This gives strays the chance for a home, and those who have been removed from their original homes a second chance at a loving 
                and happy life. Some shelters allow their cats to walk around inside their section of the building freely, meaning they are socialised with other cats more than some 
                pure-bred cats might be. However, others keep them in specified cage-like structures without any other cats with them, so they may be less socialised. They are 
                typically cheaper than bred cats, as it is to encourage you to give them a home. They can be very distrusting at the beginning, which means you have to be patient 
                with them and not expect a cuddly cat right away.</p>

            <h2>Friends and Family</h2>
            <p>Sometimes, cats need rehoming. The cat could be unhappy in the environment, the owner may be moving countries, or they simply might not be ready to take care of cats. 
                That is where you can step in. If your family or friends have a pet in need of a new place to live, you can offer to take care of them instead. With this method of 
                adoption, you may inherit some supplies like food bowls or a litter box, which can cut initial costs of adoption. While it may be a cheaper option, it does not occur 
                very frequently. This makes it an unreliable method, so it's truly a situational way to adopt a new feline friend.</p>

        <div class="extra">
            <p>No matter how you find your perfect companion, you should always keep one thing in mind when looking: Let the cat come to you. Straining a relationship with anything 
                never ends well, and is the same with cats and humans. Making sure your cat enjoys its time under your care is just as important as the enjoyment you get from having 
                them. Treat your pets with kindness.</p>
