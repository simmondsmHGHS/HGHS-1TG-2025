            <h2>Feeding</h2>
            <p>Most cats need to be fed about twice a day, but it isn't that simple. There are two common types of food; dry and wet. Dry food examples can be kibble or biscuits,
                whereas wet food comes mostly in cans. Wet food is typically recommended over dry food for a few reasons.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wet food has more moisture than dry food, which helps further with hydration.</li>
                <li>It is easier to hide medicine in wet food if your cat is a picky eater.</li>
                <li>Wet food is overall easier to eat for most cats, but can help encourage cats with dental problems or mobility issues to eat.</li>
                <li>It is easier to manage weight with canned wet food, as it comes in pre-made portions.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="maintenance">
            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
            <p>Brushing your cats varies in importance depending on the length of their hair. Longer cats are more likely to shed their fur to adapt to changing temperatures, 
                so brushing them more often than those with shorter hair. Brushing them often can prevent hair from being shed all over your home, and from hair collecting as 
                hairballs as they groom themselves.</p>
            <p>Speaking to grooming, most cats will bathe themselves, making bathing your cat not necessary most times. However, some species may require cleaning. Some longhaired 
                cats need baths to prevent matting and tangling of their fur. Hairless cats may also need baths to remove excess oil buildup on their skin. Some cats that may also 
                require bathing may have skin conditions, be older, or have some form of difficulty reaching spots on their body. In any case, protecting their ears from getting 
                water in them is recommended. Also avoid getting their faces wet through splashing or dunking their heads underwater. Make sure you use warm water and a cat-specific 
                shampoo.</p>
            <p>Maintaining a clean litter box for your cat to use is important as well if your cat is an inside cat. You should find a brand of litter that fits your budget, and a 
                well-sized litter box for the size of your pet. Cats generally prefer larger litter boxes. Cleaning the litter box once a day is recommended, and totally replacing 
                the litter every 1-2 weeks makes sure it stays fresh for your cat's use.  If you have a multiple story house, having one litter box per floor is best.</p>

        <div class="health">
            <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>Keeping up with your cat's health is also extremely important. Finding a brand of worm treatment can keep them from losing nutrients in their body to worms, and 
                finding a treatment for fleas as well protect their skin. Most forms of flea and worm treatment can come in topical ointments or oral medications. Using them as a 
                preventative measure as often as the brand suggests is also a good idea.</p>
            <p>Behavioural issues or deviation from normalcy can be a sign of illness, as well as things like newfound laziness, change in appetite or thirst, sudden weight gain or 
                loss, or changes in how vocal your cat is. If you notice these differences, it is important to get your cat checked out.</p>
